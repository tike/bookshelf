In this concise, self-contained guide, Stroustrup covers most major language features and the major standard-library components–not, of course, in great depth, but to a level that gives programmers a meaningful overview of the language, some key examples, and practical help in getting started.\n\nStroustrup presents the C++ features in the context of the programming styles they support, such as object-oriented and generic programming. His tour is remarkably comprehensive. Coverage begins with the basics, then ranges widely through more advanced topics, including many that are new in C++11, such as move semantics, uniform initialization, lambda expressions, improved containers, random numbers, and concurrency. The tour ends with a discussion of the design and evolution of C++ and the extensions added for C++11.","authors":[{"firstname":"Bjarne","middlename":"","lastname":"Stroustrup"}],"edition":0,"year":2013,"tags":["C++", "Hadoop"],"publisher":"","isbn":9780321958310,"format":{"type":"Text","pages":192,"index":true,"watermarked":false},"status":{"reviewed":false,"read":0},"source":{"name":"it-ebooks.info","id":754025531,"url":"http://filepi.com/i/QZCx4bX"}},{"id":"541a1f156da8cc1e4df40401","title":"Agile Data Science","subtitle":"Building Data Analytics Applications with Hadoop","description":"Mining big data requires a deep investment in people and time.
